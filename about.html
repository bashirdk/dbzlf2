  <h3> ABOUT SECTION </h3>
  <p> My name is Bashir, I am a crapy animator and programmer. That's all there is to know bro. </p>
  <p> This project started around 2007 back when I still went by <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/goku2020/"> goku2020. </a> I had previous <a href="http://ztage.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=5086&p=68881#p68881"> Krillin </a> version <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/goku2020/downloads.htm"> completed </a> back then and only like 20 Vegeta sprites and some Yamcha sprites. I left the LF2 scene in 2008 and returned as bashscrazy in 2011. I completed the <a href="http://dbzlf2.blogspot.ca/2011/10/krillin-character.html"> Krillin </a> and revamped it nearly completed <a href="http://dbzlf2.blogspot.ca/2011/10/vegeta-character-beta.html" >Vegeta </a> before revamping him as well. </p>
  <p> The DBZ LF2 mod officially began late 2011 and progressed extremely slow (also because I working on an <a href="http://www.lf-empire.de/forum/showthread.php?tid=5994"> LF2 Batman mod </a> in 2011!). Then in 2012 I spent time working on Vegeta which apparently took me 2 years to finish. The first release was in 2014 with only 5 characters: Base/SS/SS2 Vegeta (Buu) and Base/Super Vegito. And then the mod progressed from there to what it is now. </p>
  <p> GOALS OF THIS MOD
  <ul>
    <li> The goal of this mod is to be different from the other DBZ LF2 mods. The most popular one LF2 DBZ v2.5 and v3.0 had lots of characters but the style of the characters were all different from each other. There was no consistency. The mods that had consistency had ripped sprites from other games. </li>
    <li> Another reason to make this mod was that I wanted to play a good DBZ game on PC... Well now I have Dragon Ball Xenoverse! So that is accomplished. </li>
    <li>Next goal was to make in imbalanced mod. One where characters different in strength based on their power levels. </li>
  </ul>
